# LangChat_TCP-UDP
This is 2020 communication theory curriculum labs which contain basic use of tcp/udp interface.

**GUI APP!**

* TCP lab is chat tool.
* UDP lab is only broadcast.

First lab has bug which launch server twice could case app crash.

Technical route: cpp + qt + winsock -> so base on Windows OS.
